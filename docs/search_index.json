This means that we do not necessarily follow all of the same patterns and paths of a traditional technology education. We are educating students to assume roles in the industry, developing software applications. We value the following:\n\nImmersion in all the aspects of what it means to be a web developer.\nPractical experience and skills that can be put to use building things.\nThoughtful reflection on those skills and experiences so that students understand the deeper ramifications and meaning of their education.\nClear communication of both praise and instruction throughout the learning process.\nTimely and specific feedback designed to help students further develop the skills and knowledge.\n\nOur course and program design is strongly influenced by the key principles of the Ignatian Pedagogical Paradigm:\n\nContext\nExperience\nReflection\nAction\nEvaluation\n\nThese concepts are described in relation to online teaching and learning in the Framework for Course Innovation from the SU Center for Digital Learning and Instruction.\n"},"preparing_courses.html":{"url":"preparing_courses.html","title":"Preparing Courses for Students","keywords":"","body":"Preparing Courses\nWhen you get into your course for the first time, you will see an empty course shell. The Canvas LMS will encourage you to get building your course quickly. For WATS courses, we teach from common syllabi, so every course is a copy of the master version of the course. In order to prepare your course for students, you will need to copy the master version of the course into your new course, then you'll need to complete an audit checklist.\nIt's very important to be conscientious about looking for issues in the course before you publish it for student access. Although you can always fix issues that are noticed later (and you're expected to fix issues and notify the program director whenever they come up; see below), it's best to avoid issues in the first place. Encountering broken content or bad information in a course can ruin the experience for our students.\nPlease Note: The Course Prep process should happen 1-2 weeks before the quarter starts. If there are issues completing any of the preparation steps, please contact the WATS Program Director.\nStep One: Copy the Course\nTo copy the master course into your course, complete the following steps:\nFirst, Go to the Settings page in the course\n\nThen, Click the link in the upper right that says \"Import Course Content\"\nYou will be presented with a drop-down menu. Select \"Copy a Canvas Course\" and search for courses with \"MASTER\" in their title:\n\nSelect the Master copy of the course you are teaching and then select \"All Content\". Also be sure to select the \"Adjust events and due dates\" checkbox.\nStep Two: Invite the Support Team\nFor some courses it may be beneficial to have observers or helpers who can assist you with different tasks. Be sure to invite these people using the + People button on the People page of the course.\nIf this is the first course you're teaching for WATS, you must invite the WATS Program Director into your course as a Teacher.\nStep Three: Pre-Course Checklist\nComplete the following checklist every time you copy a course into a new instance.\n\nOpen the Assignments page and review the due dates for all assignments. Assignments should be due on the Sunday of each week at 11:59pm. Adjust any incorrect due dates.\nReview the Home page and verify that all of the links go to the proper Introduction page.\nOpen the Modules page and click through every piece of content in the course using the \"Next\" button. On each page, verify the following:\nCheck every link on the page to verify it works. (We recommend using a link checker extension in your web browser. Check My Links is a good one for Chrome.) \nRead all of the content of the course to refresh yourself with what the course is teaching.\nReview the Rubrics on assignment pages to familiarize yourself with the Learning Outcomes stressed in the course.\n\n\n\nWrite up any issues you have found. In the case of broken links, list the old link, what Module it was in, and, if at all possible, a proposed replacement. Ultimately, you'll be responsible for updating the links in your copy of the course, so the faster you can identify replacements, the faster you can get your course properly set up.\nStep Four: Publish!\nIf you've completed your work on the course, Publish it! The Publish button is on the Home page of the course. Once you click Publish, students can access the course pages. If your course is NOT published, then students cannot access it.\nStep Five: Welcome Video & Message\nOnce you have the course prepped, you should create a welcome video for Week 0 just like you would for every other week. Post it at the top of the Home page like you normally would. In this video, you should discuss the significant parts of the Week 0: About This Course module. This module is crucial because it is basically the syllabus for the course.\nAs well as posting a video, you should send students a welcome message through Canvas letting them know that the course is open and ready for them.\nThis step is really the same as your normal weekly video and email. The Canvas message is crucial because it's the only way you can get a link to your specific course in front of your students. This helps them find the online course and engage more effectively.\nStep Six: Sync with Program Director\nOnce you've got your course up and running, send an email to the Program Director describing how the process went and any concerns you have with the course. Let the Program Director know that the students have been alerted and the course is published.\n"},"weekly_cycle.html":{"url":"weekly_cycle.html","title":"The Weekly Cycle","keywords":"","body":"The Weekly Cycle\nEach course is organized as ten (10) Modules. Each Module addresses a specific topic in the course, and the Modules build on each other. Just as the structure of the course follows a distinct pattern, the weekly process of running the course also follows a pattern.\nIn order to maintain forward momentum, and to develop a keen sense of community, it is helpful to be proactive and communicative so students are kept aware that they are part of a group moving through this material together. You can help students keep up and keep in touch by reaching out regularly so that communication becomes a familiar practice and expectation rather than an exception.\nMonday\nOn Mondays you will perform the following course maintenance tasks:\n\nRotate the \"Current Week\" section on the homepage\nMove the previous week's welcome video down into the list of Modules so \n  students can revisit your welcome video if they choose.\nCopy the current Module's link and description into the highlighted \"Current Week\" area.\n\n\nRecord an introductory video for the week and post it in the \"Current Week\" area of the course homepage.\nThese videos should be 5 minutes or less. (A tutorial for one approach to making these videos is available on the SU Webdev Youtube channel. Click here to watch it.)\nOffer encouraging words based on the previous week's work. Be sure to mention any leftover items from the previous week.\nDescribe the content of the upcoming week, highlighting required readings, the assignment and the discussion for this week.\nMention any other details, such as upcoming university deadlines, Meetups, or due dates for larger projects in the course.\nBe upbeat and encouraging, but also acknowledge when content may be difficult.\nBe human! Let students get to know you through these weekly introductions. Show your enthusiasm for the material and the work they are doing.\n\n\nBegin grading. \nGrades should be completed by Wednesday at the latest.\n\n\n\nTuesday through Saturday\nThe rest of the week has fewer structured deliverables that must be met. These tasks repeat in smaller cycles throughout the week.\n\nComplete grading.\nGrading should be completed by Wednesday morning each week. Many of our assignments build on the previous assignment, so it's crucial that students receive prompt feedback on their work.\n\n\nRespond to student issues/requests.\nYou should strive for a 24-hour turnaround on any student request. If the request will take longer than 24 hours to fulfill, then you should respond to the student and let them know an expected timeline for a complete response.\nEncourage students to screenshare, live chat, or even call on the phone to work through issues. The more issues we can solve remotely, the better it is for everyone.\nFor complex issues, or recurring issues, encourage students to meet with you during lab times.\n\n\nCreate helpful additional courseware/demos/tutorials.\nVideo demos and walkthroughs are incredibly valuable to students. When you have question that is being asked repeatedly, or which requires a more textured explanation, do not be bashful about doing a little screencast video demonstration to help teach students.\nUpload your video in MP4 format to any server and notify the WATS Director to add that video to the Youtube channel.\nVideos will be added to the Seattle University Web Development Channel on Youtube promptly and made available to your students in the course.\nOnce a video is made available, you should notify your students, linking or embedding the video into your course pages.\n\n\nAttend your scheduled lab sessions.\nEach instructor of a WATS course is obligated to attend two lab sessions per week.\nLab sessions are open and do not require you to prepare a lecture or demo.\nYou should be prepared to answer questions from any web development students. \n\n\n\nAdditional tasks will creep in, and some weeks there may be an additional need to attend a meeting or discussion. Those events will be communicated with sufficient planning time, and as much as possible we will work around your schedule to accommodate you.\n"},"labs.html":{"url":"labs.html","title":"Facilitating Labs","keywords":"","body":"Facilitating Labs\nLab time is when we get to directly interact in-person with students. During labs, we don't have a lot of time to consider our words or actions, so it's important to be prepared to help students in a friendly and open way. Often, we don't realize the impact our words and actions can have, or how they can be differently interpreted, especially when we are discussing concepts we are so familiar with.\nLab Obligations\nEach instructor in WATS is required to attend one lab session per week, per course. If you are teaching one course, then you will attend one lab session per week. If you are teaching two courses, then you will attend two lab sessions per week.\nYou will work out your lab schedule with the Director of WATS prior to the start of the quarter, and that schedule should remain as consistent as possible to insure coverage in each lab session. If you need to miss your scheduled lab, communicate that to the Director of WATS in order to work out a replacement or alternative coverage.\nDuring lab you will assist students on projects and coursework. You will work with all of the WATS students, not just those in your course. You should attempt to answer any questions you can, and don't be afraid to refer questions to other instructors if that is a better solution.\nSome students will show up to just work on their coursework, as a way to discipline themselves in their studies. Others will come in with specific questions and leave as soon as you answer them. This is all fine.\nGrading Labs\nStudents must attend one lab per course per month. That means if they are enrolled in two courses, they must come to lab twice each month of the quarter. (A total of six appearances in lab.)\nWhen you come to lab you should bring a device or notebook to note who attends. Or, if you prefer, you may enter directly into Canvas. (But in general instructors don't need computers in lab, and you should be wary of using grading in Canvas around large groups of students. We must insure privacy for student grades.)\nLab Tips\nThe tips below are adapted from the Django Girls Coaching Manual. They echo policies and practice used at many different tech teaching schools, hackathons, and boot camps. \nWords\nAt all times, you need to be super careful about the words you use.\nNo jargon\nIt's hard, but possible. Don't use words and technical terminology that students many not fully understand. Remember that it's your job to educate students in these terms and help them grow, so when you do use technical jargon, be consistent and ready to explain. \nDon't say \"it's easy\" or \"just...\"\nFor your learners this may be the hardest thing they've ever done. Telling them that \"it's easy\" is not cool. Saying \"just…\" suggests that it's simple and they're failing if they find it hard to understand.\nNo feigning surprise\nDon't act surprised when people say they don't know something. Not knowing something (technical or not) is totally acceptable.\nBe prepared even for questions like: \"What is a directory?\" or \"How do I create a file?\".\nRemember: You are here to educate, not to judge students' existing knowledge.\nNo well-actually's\nA well-actually happens when someone says something that's almost - but not entirely - correct, and you say, \"well, actually…\" and then give a minor correction. This is especially annoying when the correction has no bearing on the actual conversation.\nNo subtle-isms\nSubtle-isms are small things that make others feel uncomfortable, things that we all sometimes do by mistake. For example, saying \"It's so easy my grandmother could do it\" is a subtle-ism. Like the other three social rules, this one is often accidentally broken. Like the other three, it's not a big deal to mess up – you just apologize and move on.\nThe above two sections come from [Hacker School User's Manual](https://www.hackerschool.com/manual) which is a highly recommended resource for teaching.\n\nLearn from mistakes\nAs we already mentioned, we want our attendees to really understand what they're doing, so they're not only copy-pasting the code, but they're actually learning something. That's why we chose the \"learn from mistakes\" approach here.\nOver the course of the tutorial you'll see that we're trying to first steer attendees into an error, bug or mistake. Make the attendee read the bug report and understand it. More importantly, we're trying to teach them that bugs aren't scary and that error pages are their friends. This approach will go a long way later on.\nLearn that coding is fun\nThe ultimate goal of the workshop is not to build a website. It is not to teach the whole of Django. It is also not to teach programming.\nThe ultimate goal is to show that code is fun. To get people excited. To show them that programming is not scary and that it is for everyone. To show them how powerful programming skills can be.\nThis excitement and passion will then drive them to spend endless hours trying to figure all of this out during and after the workshop.\nAtmosphere\nExcitement is good, but stress is bad for learning. We really care about the atmosphere and giving our attendees a great first experience with coding.\nImagine this: You're trying to do something difficult. You're in a room full of strangers who know how to do it better than you. You don't know how to articulate your questions. You don't know the right names for everything.\nFor most people, this is a very uncomfortable and stressful situation. But it doesn't have to be! You're there to make it easier. Here is what you can do:\n\nSmile!\nMake eye contact\nAdmit that you don't know everything\nTell them it's ok to make lots of mistakes\nTell them it's ok to get frustrated\nUse normal language, not jargon!\nAssume everyone you're coaching has zero knowledge but infinite intelligence\nGo at their pace, not your pace.\nBe friendly and kind\nUse their name\nMake sure they know they're awesome!\nAsk them if they need help -- some people are afraid to ask\nEmphasize that there is no such thing as a \"dumb\" question\nDon't say \"Any questions?\" Say \"What questions do you have?\"\nTalk sssssslllllloooooowwwwwwllllllyyyyyyyy\nWait much longer than you feel is comfortable for questions/comments\nRemoving the roadblocks\n\nFear\nA big obstacle that we try to remove is fear. In most situations, but especially school and work, people are afraid of looking stupid. This fear frequently keeps us from asking important questions like \"how does that work?\" or even just \"why?\".\nFear of making mistakes also keeps people from making progress.\nImpostor syndrome\nMadeline Kunin's research: women self-filter more than men.\nThe impostor syndrome is a psychological phenomenon in which people are unable to internalize their accomplishments. Despite external evidence of their competence, they remain convinced that they are frauds and do not deserve the success they have achieved. Impostor syndrome is particularly common among women.\nTo fight impostor syndrome:\n\nDon't accept any learner saying they are too 'whatever' to do it; assure them that they can do it.\nCongratulate people on their achievements and take some time to let them show you what they've done.\nCompliment their work.\nShow them that they actually know things.\nAnswering questions\n\nWe do not roll our eyes or laugh at questions. We do not debate which programming language, methods or technologies are \"better\".\nWe always answer positively:\n\nI’m glad you said that\nGreat question\nHm, I'm not sure... Let's look on the internet/ask someone else.\nNo back-seat driving\n\nDon't touch the keyboard\nImagine that their keyboard is made of lava. LAVA! You wouldn't touch it, right?\nWhenever you take over their keyboard, learners are going to drift away. This can be offputting and even scary.\nWe're sure you can explain what needs to be done and instruct them with your words only (it's actually a cool exercise for you too!). \nShow them how they can teach themselves\nStudents only get so many hours with us, but they will have to spend many more hours teaching themselves. Fortunately, you can make it easier for them!\nMake them Google stuff - do not give immediate answers just to make things go faster. It doesn't matter if you are going faster or slower -- what matters is whether they're going to fall in love with it or not.\nAsk about their ideas - \"How would you solve it?\", \"What do you think?\". Make them figure it out on their own. You know they know it, right?\nEncourage them to make their own changes and not to follow the tutorial too precisely - if they try to add some twists, and don't follow the tutorial at every step, they will learn much, much more. It is easy to copy-paste some code and put it in the correct location. It is harder to add something on your own and make it work.\n"},"online_tutoring.html":{"url":"online_tutoring.html","title":"Online Tutoring","keywords":"","body":"Facilitating Online Support\nWe use Slack to facilitate real-time, persistent chat among all students and instructors. This is a highly beneficial tool, and through Slack we can offer high levels of support to our students. Please make the most of Slack as you teach for us, and feel free to bring up any ideas about how we can further improve our Slack experience with the Director or larger team.\nSlack has a very good set of documentation. Please visit the Slack Help Pages to learn more about all of the things mentioned below. Click the links below for direct links into the Slack Help Pages referring to the features being discussed.\nJoining Slack\nYou can join the SU Webdev Slack with your @seattleu.edu account. Follow the instructions on the sign-up page closely (scroll down to find the link to sign-in with an SU account).\nInstructor channel\nBe sure to join #instructors when you are invited. This is a private channel where instructors are able to talk.\nCourse channels\nEach course in our Slack team has a specific channel. It's important that you find and \"join\" your course channel in Slack. When you get into your course you can look up your students in Slack and invite them to the course channel. Try to do that during the first week of class. Most students will find the course channel and join without prompting, but Slack can be confusing for some students who are less experienced with social chat tools. \nNote: If you are teaching courses early in the sequence, you may have students who have never used Slack before. It's important to interact with them via Slack and help them learn the ropes as they complete those first courses. This is a tool that will benefit them for many years to come.\nPosting\nIn Slack the default post is just a message. However, you can use the \"+\" sign next to the message to make different types of posts. For some things, such as uploading screenshots or weekly welcome posts, it may be preferable to use an alternate post format.\nIn addition to using the proper post type, understanding formatting in Slack can help make your messages more understandable. Review the Slack guides to formatting messages for more about how you can control the presentation of your words.\nNotifications\nYou can install Slack pretty much anywhere. There are webapps and native apps that should suit everyone's needs. You can also configure very specifically how Slack sends you notifications. Please take advantage of these features to allow Slack to fit into your life. Obviously we don't want you to be oppressed by being constantly on-call, but for the most part we've found that Slack intrusions are manageable. Often we can help somebody with just a couple minutes of effort, and that can save the student hours of their week. \nPrivate chats\nYou can create private channels and direct messages for students. Students themselves can create private channels for discussion. Review the Slack documentation for more information about how these can be managed. When you run a command in the private channel (for example, to start a video chat), it is usually only the people in that private channel who can see it. This is very handy for working with students.\nSlack apps\nWe have a few apps installed in Slack to help us communicate. Most of them are passive and enhance all the messages in the channel. But some of them give us new commands. You can run commands by typing a message that begins with a slash (/) and a command word. Two Slack commands you should be familiar with are: /appear and /hangout. These commands will each create a video chat using either Appear.in or Google Hangouts. You should try these commands out on your own and make sure you have your computer configured so you can use these tools when you need.\nNote: Using these video chat tools allows us to share screens with students. When a student can share her screen with us, then we can easily help just as effectively as we can in lab. This is a hugely powerful capability. Rather than getting frustrated trying to figure out problems in text chat, please don't be bashful about saying to the student, \"I think we need to do a video chat. I can do that [today, tomorrow, etc.] at XYZ time.\" or \"Can you get on a video chat with me? I need to see what you're doing in order to help you.\"\nAdditional discussion\nEveryone is encouraged to make the most of Slack. Please be aware that everyone is always \"joined\" on the #general channel. You should review the Slack guidelines for using the General channel in order to avoid spamming the entire team. We actively use the #random channel, and when we are at conferences we post in the #conferences channel. Feel free to create or suggest creating any other channels we need.\n"},"giving_feedback.html":{"url":"giving_feedback.html","title":"Giving Feedback","keywords":"","body":"Giving Feedback\nProviding timely, accurate, and detailed feedback is critical when responding to student work. Each week students will produce work that involves writing code and creating media. This work deserves high quality feedback. \nThere are several ways we can provide feedback to students with the tools at our disposal. We should leverage all these mechanisms to make sure our students have the best feedback possible.\nTiming Feedback\nIt's essential for students to receive feedback as soon as possible. If they have asked a question, or have trouble on an assignment, you should respond to them in 24 hours or less. Normally, it's possible to send a quick reply such as, \"Tricky problem! Let me think and I'll get back to you shortly,\" so the student knows they can expect a reply. \nStudents often become discouraged when they send a question or ask for help and they receive silence in response.\nFeedback Within Canvas\nWithin Canvas you should give feedback using the Rubrics and the Assignment Comments feature. For some assignments, where students turn in a document or PDF, you may also be able to use some editing/markup tools to indicate more specific feedback on their work.\nWhen grading the rubric, each Criterion is assessed on a 5-point scale. Three (3) points indicates basic mastery of the outcome. Five (5) points indicates exceptional mastery. Four (4) points indicates a solid mastery of that Criterion.\nWhile filling in the Rubric, it's useful to mention general things that affected the grade. For example, if a student receives less than a 3 on any Criterion, you should probably add a comment about why. Likewise, when students get 5s you should probably mention what they did to excel.\nThe rubric is not a place to write lengthy comments, though. So keep the comments in the rubric brief and pointed. You should also add a more general Assignment Comment, which does allow for a more lengthy message. You should ALWAYS post an Assignment Comment (even if you have left several comments on the Rubric itself).\nYour Assignment Comments should contextualize the overall work the student has handed in. Summarize the points you made in any Rubric comments, and indicate any feedback that might exist outside Canvas (especially Github comments). If a student has done especially bad on any portion of the assignment, you should also suggest revisions the student could work on and resubmit.\nFeedback Within Github\nGithub is a valuable tool to us throughout the program. Most assignments in the Production Courses are handed in via Github, which gives us a valuable insight into the process a student has gone through to complete an assignment.\nYou should be reviewing their code on Github when they turn it in. Think of this as a code review like you would do for any project you're working on, and use the same guidelines we always use for code reviews:\n\nOffer helpful corrections where there are errors\nOffer suggestions for improvement at both large and small scales\nFill in gaps of knowledge indicated by the code (don't just demand specific changes)\n\n"},"discussion_tips.html":{"url":"discussion_tips.html","title":"Tips for Enhancing Discussions","keywords":"","body":"Discussion Tips\nThroughout the course students must participate in discussions. Each of the discussion prompts is unique. Some discussions require students to go out into the world and try something, or research some topic, then return to the discussion to share. Other prompts ask students to reflect on the work they've been doing, or the resources they have engaged with, and offer some commentary or reflection.\nAs an instructor, it's your job to help these discussions move forward and be relevant to students. You should participate in the discussions, too, but in a way that does not dominate the discussion. You are playing the role of facilitator and moderator in discussions, so your goal is not to be the star participant, per se.\nSome tips for facilitating discussions\n\nRespond to individual postings with additional questions.\nAsk follow-up questions such as, \"Can you explain more about why you think that?\" or, \"What if X were changed to Y, would your opinion change? Why?\" \nAsk open-ended questions that allow students to expound on their statements, rather than giving a yes/no answer. \n\n\nEncourage students to provide links or to quote material they have found.\nExpress appreciation for student posts, especially when they have come up with a clever metaphor or idea. Phrases such as \"thanks for pointing that out\" or \"thanks for sharing that link\" are very helpful and encouraging to students.\n\nSometimes students post incorrect or misleading information. If this is done maliciously, then you may have an issue that should be handled outside the scope of the discussion itself. However, most of the time this results from some core misunderstanding of the material. When addressing incorrect (or partially-incorrect) posts, do so in a compassionate and educational manner. Remember, nobody learns from shame or punishment. Students only learn from encouragement and success. The goal is always to lead students to the correction, and it must never be to shame students for supplying erroneous information.\nIf a student posts an erroneous fact or statement in a discussion, here are some tips for responding:\n\nTry to understand why the student made the mistake. Is it an easy mistake to make? What precisely don't they understand? In order to correct the mistake, you must first try to understand what mistake they made and why they made it.\nFrame your corrections in language that acknowledges what the student did right in their response. If there are accurate portions of the response, call those out and praise those. \nProvide a correction and a link to read more. Don't feel the need to make your correction incredibly verbose. Again, the point is not to make it clear HOW wrong the student was, simply to correct an inaccuracy so that misinformation does not continue to spread.\n\nAvoid \"well, actually...\"\nA \"well, actually...\" happens when somebody corrects a minor inaccuracy, and it's especially annoying when the correction bears little relevance on the topic at hand. In cases of small misapprehensions or mis-statements, it's always good to give the student the benefit of the doubt. They have mis-typed or mis-spoken, but it might not warrant a full-blown correction as described above. \nUse your best judgement as you work with students. Only provide public corrections when the misinformation could be detrimental to other students understanding. All other issues can be discussed in private and in a way that is compassionate and thoughtful towards the student's well-being.\n"},"grading.html":{"url":"grading.html","title":"Grading","keywords":"","body":"Grading\nGrading is a crucial part of teaching a course. Students must understand how well they achieved the learning outcomes for each assignment, and the grade is one of the primary methods for an instructor to convey that information to a student.\nEach graded assignment in the course is not the same, and should not be treated the same. Grades are calculated across the board for you, so for the most part you need only to determine the grades for each assignment and the rest of the work will be handled by Canvas. Even so, it's useful to keep a few things in mind as you grade.\nGrading Projects\nAll grades should be derived from the rubrics attached to each assignment. For projects, the majority of rubric criteria relate directly to a course learning outcome that is mapped on the Learning Outcomes page of the course. Each rubric criterion has a name and a description, which can be viewed by clicking the \"view description\" link in the assignment rubric. The different levels of performance are defined in detail for each rubric criterion. Select the proper level of achievement for each rubric criterion and the score will be tabulated automatically when you save the rubric evaluation.\nWhenever there is a question about evaluating a particular rubric criterion or adjusting a score, instructors should feel free to bring up the question to the director of the program or fellow instructors. At no time should individual students or student-associated grades be discussed, but it is fine to discuss what the goals of a criterion are, or how to best evaluate the rubrics.\nGrading Discussions\nDiscussions are graded according to a discussion rubric that is designed to encourage participation and communication. Sticking with the rubric criteria when grading increases the number of student posts and the quality of their engagement. These assignments should be graded like any other.\nTimeliness in Grading\nIt's important to grade in a timely manner. Students rely on grades to gauge their progress in the course, so they require that constant feedback. The cadence of handing in work and giving feedback is crucial to a good class experience.\nYou should also consider the way your grading rhythm affects students. Especially when students are struggling, it can be very damaging to fall behind in grading and then send a student a string of low graded assignments. Students will always react better to finding out about bad grades sooner rather than later. And giving students more time to react to low grades makes it much easier to work with them to improve those grades.\nLate Assignments\nFor the most part, we aim to have a system that is tolerant enough of the regular fluctuations of adult life to allow for some flexibility on late assignments. Given the technical nature of our courses, it's not unusual for somebody to have very good intentions, but to get stuck over a weekend before a deadline on a very small matter that they can quickly clear up with a brief chat with the instructor on Monday. In these cases, and other reasonable cases, you are encouraged to be as generous as possible when considering late work.\nAlthough we want to teach our students to be timely and responsible, we also do not want to create artificial penalties for late work, especially when there is a reasonable explanation for the tardiness. However, we also do not want our students to fall behind. Our courses are only 10 weeks long, and students who fall behind can quickly find themselves under water.\nIf you notice a student is not keeping up with work, contact the student and NCS Student Support staff as soon as possible.\nRevisions\nIn many cases, allowing students to revise work is a very beneficial thing. In the world of web development, no work is ever finished, and we are not allowed to stop trying just because we don't get something right the first time. In cases where students know they are having troubles, you're encouraged to get them to turn in an assignment on time and then revise it in the following days.\nThe material we teach often seems easy to us because we have been doing it for so long, but always remember that every single thing we use to make websites is actually very difficult to grasp and work with for a complete novice. At one point, we were all in that place. And part of how we've come so far is by trying and trying again.\nThe Canvas LMS will allow you to alter grades after you have submitted them. Be aware that grades are sent to the student as soon as you assign them, so everytime you assign or change a grade, the student will get a notification. It's always good to provide an additional comment on the assignment when you change a grade for any reason. (It's generally bad to revise a grade downward without some noteworthy circumstances--cheating, plagiarism, etc.)\n"},"support.html":{"url":"support.html","title":"Support","keywords":"","body":"Support for Instructors\nAs instructors in WATS, you enjoy the support of the SU School of New and Continuing Studies staff and systems. In turn, those services and individuals can direct you to an even larger community of support around the SU campus. Take a moment to learn about some of the useful support services and professionals who can help you with your teaching work.\nStudent Support\nOne of the primary reasons to reach out to the broader WATS, NCS, and SU communities is to get help for a student. As an instructor, you are in the position to observe any issues a student is encountering and to help them seek assistance. \nAny questions you have about student support can be directed to Suki Kwon, the NCS Student Success Specialist. You may email her at kwonsu@seattleu.edu. Suki is a longtime student support professional who can both provide you guidance if you have questions about talking or working with a student, and who can work directly with the student to guide them to support services all around campus. \nIn addition to our professional staff, SU faculty is able to use the Starfish system to help track issues. The Starfish system allows you to register an alert if students fail to participate in class, if their work is not up to par, or if there are any other issues. When you report issues through Starfish, the student receives a notification as well as NCS and WATS staff (including the WATS Program Director and the Student Success Specialist).\nInstructor Support\nInstructors are required to complete a basic online training through the SU Center for Digital Learning and Instruction (CDLI). This training is required for state authorization compliance, and it is a valuable introduction to the practice of teaching courses in online and hybrid formats. \nYou will receive a notification about the required CDLI training for instructors in your SU email. Please keep an eye out for that.\nIn addition to the CDLI required training, there are opportunities for further training and one-on-one training and support sessions with CDLI staff. The CDLI staff are trained instructional designers who are happy to discuss many aspects of managing a hybrid course.\nIf you are encountering any issues with your teaching, please reach out directly to the Director of WATS. We take instructor success as seriously as we take student success, and there are many services on campus that can be arranged to help you improve your process and results. Issues like time management, communicating with students, building presence, or managing behavioral problems in the classroom are all commonly experienced difficulties for faculty, and we can put you in touch with people who can help work through those things.\n"},"contacts_links.html":{"url":"contacts_links.html","title":"Contacts and Links","keywords":"","body":"Useful Contacts and Links\nDuring your time teaching at SU, there are some useful contacts and links that you will make use of over and over.
