# Philosophy and Approach

The WATS program is designed to help students learn technology skills in an accelerated, immersive, craft-based manner. This means that we do not necessarily follow all of the same patterns and paths of a traditional technology education. We are educating students to assume roles in the industry, developing software applications. We value the following:

* Immersion in all the aspects of what it means to be a web developer.
* Practical experience and skills that can be put to use building things.
* Thoughtful reflection on those skills and experiences so that students understand the deeper ramifications and meaning of their education.
* Clear communication of both praise and instruction throughout the learning process.
* Timely and specific feedback designed to help students further develop the skills and knowledge.

Our course and program design is strongly influenced by the key principles of the [Ignatian Pedagogical Paradigm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ignatian_Pedagogical_Paradigm):

* Context
* Experience
* Reflection
* Action
* Evaluation

These concepts are described in relation to online teaching and learning in the [Framework for Course Innovation](http://cope.seattleu.edu/framework-for-course-innovation.html) from the SU Center for Digital Learning and Instruction.
